    "text": "I think being a data scientist is about taking messy, real-world data and turning it into useful insights. Itâ€™s not just about writing code or running models, but also about asking the right questions and communicating results with stakeholders so they can make better decisions.\nSome differences and similarities I see between data scientists and statisticians are:\n- **Similarities**: both use data, probability, and statistical thinking to answer questions.\n- **Differences**: statisticians often emphasize theory, inference, and study design, while data scientists tend to focus more on working with larger datasets, coding, and applying machine learning techniques.\nIn terms of how I view myself:\n- I have a solid background in statistics, so I connect with the statistician side.\n- At the same time, I work full time as a Data Scientist in Inventory Management.\n- My goal is to strengthen my knowledge in Statistics."
